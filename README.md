# Repository Overview

This repository contains code references for the **BIO309 Computational Biology** at Southern University of Science and Technology.

## Content Overview:

- **lab4**: `hg38_tool.sh` script for processing FASTA files, primarily targeting the human genome reference sequence `hg38.fa`. It provides functionalities like file checking, N base counting, chromosome length calculation, and subsequence extraction.

- **lab6**: `transcript_analyzer.py` script for sequence processing, which filters sequences by length and GC content, identifies ATG start codons, translates to protein sequences, and counts G4 RNA motifs.

- **lab8**: Instructions for processing and analyzing transcript data from the GENCODE release 49 dataset using `awk`. It includes tasks such as extracting specific transcript information, filtering by gene type, classifying transcripts by length, and generating summary statistics like transcript counts and average lengths by gene type.
